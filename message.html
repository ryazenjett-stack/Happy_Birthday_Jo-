    <h2>Dear Jenah Roxanne,</h2>
    <p>
      I know this might feel sudden, but I needed to say what I kept inside.  
      You deserved honesty and care that I failed to give before.  
      I made mistakes that hurt you and pushed you away, and I think about them more than I admit.  
      Every day, I wish I had handled things with more patience and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still remember your laugh, your warmth, and the small things that made us feel real.  
      Losing that connection made me realize how much you mattered in ways words cannot measure.  
      I never meant to cause you pain. I am sorry for all the times I made you doubt my heart.  
      You deserve someone who listens, respects, and stays true.  
      I hope you find peace and happiness, whether or not I am part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy birthday once more. I hope your year ahead brings calm days, comfort, and the kind of love that feels steady.  
      If you ever choose to talk again, I’ll be grateful for the chance to start over, even as friends.  
      Thank you for every moment that once made us feel alive.
    </p>
    <p>— From someone who still cares</p>
